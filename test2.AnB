Protocol: KeyEx
#Problem with this file: (what attack is found/what change should be made)
# Necessary messages are sent, but not securely (only communication between customer and gateway is secure)

Types:

	# Customer, Merchant and Gateway
  Agent C,M,G;
  Number Pricing,Order,CreditCard;
  Symmetric_key KAB,CM;
	# public key, shared key and hash function
  Function pk,sk,h;

Knowledge:

  C: C, M, G, pk(M), pk(G), sk(C,G), h;
  # Only merchant has a public/private key pair
  M: C, M, G, pk(M), pk(G), inv(pk(M)), h;
  G: C, M, G, pk(M), pk(G), inv(pk(G)), sk(C,G);

Actions:

C->M: {C, M, Order, h(Order), KAB}pk(M)
M->C: {|C, M, Pricing|}KAB
  # Since the gateway should not know the order, a hash function of it is sent instead
C->G: {|C, G, CreditCard, Pricing, h(Order)|}sk(C,G)
G->C: {|C, G|}sk(C,G)
C->G: {|C, G|}sk(C,G)
G->M: {{G, M, Pricing, h(Order)}inv(pk(G))}pk(M)

Goals:

sk(C,G) secret between C, G
# Order secret between C, M
C->*M:Order
CreditCard secret between C, G
# KAB secret between C,G
# C authenticates G on KAB


# C authenticates G on KAB
# KAB secret between C,G
# CM secret between C,M
